# Intention Recognition


### Preliminaries

- Install requirements.txt
- Source Terminal


**_If you run both Modules on different Machines:_**

- To run this Module you need rosmessages from intention_reaction_ws. So make shure in your terminal is sourced Rospackage panda-intention-reaction.
- Make shure ROS-Network-Settings are correct. 


### Run Project

- Intention Recognition from camera: `make-detection.py`
- Intention Recognition from .bag file: `make-detection-from-file.py`

### For Developrers

- Notebook for ML-Model: `/machine_learning/intention-recognition.ipynb`
- Get Features from Folder containing .bag files with Interaction `get-data.py`
